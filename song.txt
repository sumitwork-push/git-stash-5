And there is something in me
I can't believe what I see
The dark is taking my mind
Don't wanna leave you behind

Maybe you're taking too wrong
Maybe you're getting too high
I only do what I should
But you're in Hollywood
Where streets are black and blue
And you can make it tonight
Having the time of your life
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?
